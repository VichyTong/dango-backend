5. merge(table_name, label_1, label_2, glue, new_label, axis): Concatenates two labels and appends the merged label to the table.

6. split(table_name, label, delimiter, new_labels): Splits a label into multiple parts at the occurrences of the specified delimiter.

7. transpose(table_name): Converts rows to columns and columns to rows in the table.

8. aggregate(table_name, label, operation, axis): Aggregates the table using the specified function.

# EXAMPLES #

Example 1:
'''
- INPUT:
# Sheet 1
Sheet Information: Heart Disease Prediction dataset.csv has 14 columns (Headers are: A: "age", B: "sex", C: "cp", D: "trestbps", E: "chol", F: "fbs", G: "restecg", H: "thalach", I: "exang", J: "oldpeak", K: "slope", L: "ca", M: "thal", N: "target") and 303 rows (0 to 302, the row 0 is the header row).

User Instruction: Transposes the table.

User Intent: The user wants to transpose the table.

Generated DSL:
```
drop("Heart Disease Prediction dataset.csv", [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19], 0)

    "feedback": {
        "error": {
            "error_type": "Semantic Error",
            "function_name": "drop",
            "error_message": "The 'drop' function is used incorrectly. The 'drop' function is meant to remove rows or columns from a table, not transpose the table. You should use the 'transpose' function to transpose the table."

- label_b (str or int): The label of the row/column to be swapped in the second table.
- axis (str or int): Refers to the direction of the operation.

9. merge(table_name_a, table_name_b, on, how, axis): Merges two tables based on a common column or along columns.
Parameters:
- table_name_a (str): The first table to merge.
- table_name_b (str): The second table to merge.
- on (list[str]): The column or index level name to join on (ignored if axis=1).
- how (str): The type of merge to perform ('inner', 'outer', 'left', 'right').
- axis (str or int): Refers to the direction of the operation.

10. concatenate(table_name, label_a, label_b, glue, new_label, axis): Concatenates two labels and appends the merged label to the table.
Parameters:

# INPUT #
- Sheet Information: The name of the sheet, the headers, and the number of rows in the table.
- DSL Definition: The definition of the Domain Specific Language and its functionalities.
- User Intent: A summary of what the user wants to achieve with the DSL.
- Generated DSL: The DSL code generated to fulfill the user's intent.

# OUTPUT #

- Determination of Correctness: A "Yes" or "No" answer indicating whether the generated DSL correctly implements the required functionalities based on the sheet information and the DSL definition.
- DSL Feedback: An analysis of whether the generated DSL correctly implements the required functionalities based on the sheet information and the DSL definition.
You need to output in this json form:
{
    "correctness": "<Yes/No>",
    "feedback": "<Feedback message>"
}

# EXAMPLES #

Example 1:
'''
- INPUT:
# Sheet 1
Sheet Information: Heart Disease Prediction dataset.csv has 14 columns (Headers are: A: "age", B: "sex", C: "cp", D: "trestbps", E: "chol", F: "fbs", G: "restecg", H: "thalach", I: "exang", J: "oldpeak", K: "slope", L: "ca", M: "thal", N: "target") and 303 rows (0 to 302, the row 0 is the header row).

User Instruction: delete row 1 to row 20

User Intent: The user wants to delete rows 1 to 20 in Heart Disease Prediction dataset.csv.

Generated DSL:
```
drop("Heart Disease Prediction dataset.csv", [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19], 0)
```

- OUTPUT:
{
    "correctness": "No",
    "feedback": "The generated DSL does not correctly implement the required functionality. Because row 0 is the header row, the deletion should start from row 1 to row 20, not from row 0."
}

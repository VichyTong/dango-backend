# OBJECTIVE #
Generate a step-by-step plan to clean the data based on the user's intents and the sheet information.

#############

# DSL GRAMMAR #
{DSL_GRAMMAR}

#############

# GUIDELINES #
1. You should specify the DSL function after the description. Do not add or invent new functions.
2. You should point out the arguments for each function based on the given description, please refer to the column and row information in the sheet information.
3. Please attention that the row index starts from 0, which is the header row. The column index starts from 1.

#############

# INPUT #
- Sheet Information: the name of the sheet, the headers, and the number of rows in the table.
- User Intents: the user's intents.

#############

# OUTPUT #
- Step-by-step plan: a JSON list.
    - Each step should only include the function name and its description.
    - If there are multiple steps, list them in the order they should be executed.

Example format:
[
    {
        "function": "function_name",
        "description": "step_description"
    }
]

# EXAMPLES #

Example 1:
'''
- INPUT:
# Sheet 1
Sheet Information: Heart Disease Prediction dataset.csv has 15 columns (Headers are: ["age", "sex", "cp", "trestbps", "chol", "fbs", "restecg", "thalach", "exang", "oldpeak", "slope", "ca", "thal", "target"], the column 0 is the header column) and 303 rows (0 to 302, the row 0 is the header row).
User Intents: The user's intent is to drop the column "ca" and "thal".

- OUTPUT:
[
    {
        "function": "drop",
        "description": "Drop the column \"ca\" in Heart Disease Prediction dataset.csv."
    },
    {
        "function": "drop",
        "description": "Drop the column \"thal\" in Heart Disease Prediction dataset.csv."
    }
]
'''

Example 2:
'''
- INPUT:
# Sheet 1
Sheet Information: Heart Disease Prediction dataset.csv has 15 columns (Headers are: ["age", "sex", "cp", "trestbps", "chol", "fbs", "restecg", "thalach", "exang", "oldpeak", "slope", "ca", "thal", "target"], the column 0 is the header column) and 303 rows (0 to 302, the row 0 is the header row).

# Sheet 2
Sheet Information: New.csv has 3 columns (Headers are: 1: "location", 2: "nationality", the column 0 is the header column) and 303 rows (0 to 302, the row 0 is the header row).

User Intents: The user's intent is to move "age" and "sex" columns from Sheet 1 to Sheet 2.

- OUTPUT:
[
    {
        "function": "copy",
        "description": "Copy the column \"age\" from Heart Disease Prediction dataset.csv to New.csv."
    },
    {
        "function": "copy",
        "description": "Copy the column \"sex\" from Heart Disease Prediction dataset.csv to New.csv."
    },
    {
        "function": "drop",
        "description": "Delete the column \"age\" from Heart Disease Prediction dataset.csv."
    },
    {
        "function": "drop",
        "description": "Delete the column \"sex\" from Heart Disease Prediction dataset.csv."
    }
]
'''

Example 3:
'''
- INPUT:
# Sheet 1
Sheet Information: Heart Disease Prediction dataset.csv has 15 columns (Headers are: ["age", "sex", "cp", "trestbps", "chol", "fbs", "restecg", "thalach", "exang", "oldpeak", "slope", "ca", "thal", "target"], the column 0 is the header column) and 303 rows (0 to 302, the row 0 is the header row).

User Intents: The user's intent is to test the similarity between the columns "age" and "sex".

- OUTPUT:
[
    {
        "function": "test",
        "description": "Test the similarity between the columns \"age\" and \"sex\" in Heart Disease Prediction dataset.csv using t-test."
    }
]
'''

Example 4:
'''
- INPUT:
# Sheet 1
Sheet Information: Heart Disease Prediction dataset.csv has 15 columns (Headers are: ["age", "sex", "cp", "trestbps", "chol", "fbs", "restecg", "thalach", "exang", "oldpeak", "slope", "ca", "thal", "target"], the column 0 is the header column) and 303 rows (0 to 302, the row 0 is the header row).

User intents: The user wants to concatenate the "age" and "sex" with a comma and space if there are no missing values in the columns.

- OUTPUT:
[
    {
        "function": "concatenate",
        "description": "Concatenate the columns \"age\" and \"sex\" in Heart Disease Prediction dataset.csv with a comma and space if there are no missing values."
    }

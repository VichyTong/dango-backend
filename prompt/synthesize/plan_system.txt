# OBJECTIVE #
Generate a step-by-step plan to clean the data based on the user's intents.

#############

# DSL GRAMMAR #

## DSL Functions:

1. create_table(table_name, row_number, column_number): Creates a new empty table with the specified number of rows and columns.

2. delete_table(table_name): Deletes the specified table.

3. insert(table_name, index, name, axis): Inserts an empty row or column at the specified index in the table.

4. drop(table_name, label, axis): Drops a row or column in the table.

5. assign(table_name, row, column, value): Assigns a value to a specific cell in the table.

6. copy(origin_table_name, index, target_table_name, target_index, new_label, axis): Copies a row or column from index in the origin table to the target table at the target index.

7. merge(table_name, label_1, label_2, glue, new_label, axis): Concatenates two labels and appends the merged label to the table.

8. split(table_name, label, delimiter, new_labels): Splits a label into multiple parts at the occurrences of the specified delimiter.

9. transpose(table_name): Converts rows to columns and columns to rows in the table.

10. aggregate(table_name, label, operation, axis): Aggregates the table using the specified function.

11. test(table_name, label_1, label_2, strategy, axis): Returns a new result table of comparing two labels using the specified strategy.

# GUIDELINES #
1. You should only use the DSL functions provided in the DSL Grammar. Do not add or invent new functions.
2. You should point out the arguments for each function based on the given description.

#############

# INPUT #
- Sheet Information: the name of the sheet, the headers, and the number of rows in the table.
- User Intents: the user's intents.

# OUTPUT #

- Step-by-step plan: a sequence of descriptions of the actions to be taken to clean the data based on the user's intents.

# EXAMPLES #

Example 1:
'''
- INPUT:
# Sheet 1
Sheet Information: Heart Disease Prediction dataset.csv has 14 columns (Headers are: A: "age", B: "sex", C: "cp", D: "trestbps", E: "chol", F: "fbs", G: "restecg", H: "thalach", I: "exang", J: "oldpeak", K: "slope", L: "ca", M: "thal", N: "target") and 303 rows (the row 0 is the header row).
User Intents: The user's intent is to drop the column "ca" and "thal".

- OUTPUT:
Step-by-step plan:
1. Delete the column "ca". (drop function)
2. Delete the column "thal". (drop function)
'''

Example 2:
'''
- INPUT:
# Sheet 1
Sheet Information: Heart Disease Prediction dataset.csv has 14 columns (Headers are: A: "age", B: "sex", C: "cp", D: "trestbps", E: "chol", F: "fbs", G: "restecg", H: "thalach", I: "exang", J: "oldpeak", K: "slope", L: "ca", M: "thal", N: "target") and 303 rows (the row 0 is the header row).
User Intents: The user's intent is to delete all the columns except "age" and "sex".

- OUTPUT:
Step-by-step plan:
1. Drop all columns except "age" and "sex" in Heart Disease Prediction dataset.csv. (drop function)
'''

Example 3:
'''
- INPUT:
# Sheet 1
Sheet Information: Heart Disease Prediction dataset.csv has 14 columns (Headers are: A: "age", B: "sex", C: "cp", D: "trestbps", E: "chol", F: "fbs", G: "restecg", H: "thalach", I: "exang", J: "oldpeak", K: "slope", L: "ca", M: "thal", N: "target") and 303 rows (the row 0 is the header row).

# Sheet 2
Sheet Information: New.csv has 14 columns (Headers are: "A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J", "K", "L", "M", "N") and 303 rows (the row 0 is the header row).

User Intents: The user's intent is to move "age" and "sex" columns from Sheet 1 to Sheet 2.

- OUTPUT:
Step-by-step plan:
1. Copy the column "age" from Heart Disease Prediction dataset.csv to New.csv. (copy function)
2. Copy the column "sex" from Heart Disease Prediction dataset.csv to New.csv. (copy function)
3. Delete the column "age" from Heart Disease Prediction dataset.csv. (drop function)
4. Delete the column "sex" from Heart Disease Prediction dataset.csv. (drop function)
'''

Example 4:
'''
- INPUT:
# Sheet 1
Sheet Information: Heart Disease Prediction dataset.csv has 14 columns (Headers are: A: "age", B: "sex", C: "cp", D: "trestbps", E: "chol", F: "fbs", G: "restecg", H: "thalach", I: "exang", J: "oldpeak", K: "slope", L: "ca", M: "thal", N: "target") and 303 rows (the row 0 is the header row).

User Intents: The user's intent is to test the similarity between the columns "age" and "sex".

- OUTPUT:
Step-by-step plan:
1. Test the similarity between the columns "age" and "sex" in Heart Disease Prediction dataset.csv using t-test. (test function)

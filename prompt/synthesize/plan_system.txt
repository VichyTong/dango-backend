# OBJECTIVE #
Generate a step-by-step plan to clean the data based on the user's intents.

#############

# DSL GRAMMAR #

## DSL Functions:

1. create: Create columns or tables to a specified number in the table.

2. drop: Deletes a specified label in the table.
   
3. move: Relocates a label from one position to another within the same table or to a different table.

4. copy: Copies a label and appends it to the end of the target table.

5. merge: Concatenates two labels and appends the merged label to the table.

6. split: Splits a label into multiple parts at the occurrences of the specified delimiter.

7. transpose: Converts rows to columns and columns to rows in the table.

8. aggregate: Aggregates the table using the specified function.

9. test: Returns the test result of comparing two labels using the specified strategy.

#############

# GUIDELINES #
1. You should only use the DSL functions provided in the DSL Grammar. Do not add or invent new functions.

#############

# INPUT #
- Sheet Information: the name of the sheet, the headers, and the number of rows in the table.
- User Intents: the user's intents.

# OUTPUT #

- Step-by-step plan: a sequence of descriptions of the actions to be taken to clean the data based on the user's intents.

# EXAMPLES #

Example 1:
'''
- INPUT:
# Sheet 1
Sheet Information: Heart Disease Prediction dataset.csv has 14 columns (Headers are: A: "age", B: "sex", C: "cp", D: "trestbps", E: "chol", F: "fbs", G: "restecg", H: "thalach", I: "exang", J: "oldpeak", K: "slope", L: "ca", M: "thal", N: "target") and 303 rows (the row 0 is the header row).
User Intents: The user's intent is to drop the column "ca" and "thal".

- OUTPUT:
Step-by-step plan:
1. Drop the column "ca". (drop function)
2. Drop the column "thal". (drop function)
'''

Example 2:
'''
- INPUT:
# Sheet 1
Sheet Information: Heart Disease Prediction dataset.csv has 14 columns (Headers are: A: "age", B: "sex", C: "cp", D: "trestbps", E: "chol", F: "fbs", G: "restecg", H: "thalach", I: "exang", J: "oldpeak", K: "slope", L: "ca", M: "thal", N: "target") and 303 rows (the row 0 is the header row).
User Intents: The user's intent is to delete all the columns except "age" and "sex".

- OUTPUT:
Step-by-step plan:
1. Drop all columns except "age" and "sex" in Heart Disease Prediction dataset.csv. (drop function)
'''

Example 3:
'''
- INPUT:
# Sheet 1
Sheet Information: Heart Disease Prediction dataset.csv has 14 columns (Headers are: A: "age", B: "sex", C: "cp", D: "trestbps", E: "chol", F: "fbs", G: "restecg", H: "thalach", I: "exang", J: "oldpeak", K: "slope", L: "ca", M: "thal", N: "target") and 303 rows (the row 0 is the header row).

# Sheet 2
Sheet Information: New.csv has 14 columns (Headers are: "A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J", "K", "L", "M", "N") and 303 rows (the row 0 is the header row).

User Intents: The user's intent is to move "age" and "sex" columns from Sheet 1 to Sheet 2.

- OUTPUT:
Step-by-step plan:
1. Move the column "age" from Heart Disease Prediction dataset.csv to New.csv. (move function)
2. Move the column "sex" from Heart Disease Prediction dataset.csv to New.csv. (move function)
'''

Example 4:
'''
- INPUT:
# Sheet 1
Sheet Information: Heart Disease Prediction dataset.csv has 14 columns (Headers are: A: "age", B: "sex", C: "cp", D: "trestbps", E: "chol", F: "fbs", G: "restecg", H: "thalach", I: "exang", J: "oldpeak", K: "slope", L: "ca", M: "thal", N: "target") and 303 rows (the row 0 is the header row).

User Intents: The user's intent is to test the similarity between the columns "age" and "sex".

- OUTPUT:
Step-by-step plan:
1. Create a new table name test_result.csv to store the test result. (create function)
2. Test the similarity between the columns "age" and "sex" in Heart Disease Prediction dataset.csv using t-test. (test function)

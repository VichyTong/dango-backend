## DSL Functions:
Common Definitions:
- label: Refers to a row or column in the table. If the label is the name of a row or column, it should be a string. If the label is the index of a row or column, it should be an integer.
- axis: Refers to the direction of the operation.
  - 0 or "index": Indicates a row operation.
  - 1 or "columns": Indicates a column operation.

### Guidelines
1. For column/row-level functions, our DSL supports a natural language string "condition," specifically used for handling if-type conditional statements to specify which rows or columns to operate on.
2. You must set all the required parameters in the function.

### Table-level Functions

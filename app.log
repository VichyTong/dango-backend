# CONTEXT #
You are a professional data scientist. You want to summarize the table diff information made by the user in the CSV file. 

#############

# OBJECTIVE #
Summarize the table diff information in Natural Language.

############

# GUIDELINES #
Please note that a value replaced with 'null' means deleted, and a value replaced from 'null' means inserted.

#############

# INPUT #
The diff information contains:
- Table name
- Difference detail (row, col, old_value, new_value)

#############

# EXAMPLES #
Example 1:
```
table1.csv
{'row': 4, 'col': 1, 'old_value': null, 'new_value': '1'}
{'row': 4, 'col': 2, 'old_value': null, 'new_value': '2'}
{'row': 4, 'col': 3, 'old_value': null, 'new_value': '3'}
{'row': 4, 'col': 4, 'old_value': null, 'new_value': '4'}
{'row': 4, 'col': 5, 'old_value': null, 'new_value': '5'}
```
In table1.csv, the user sequentially inserts values into the fourth row according to column number.

---

Example 2:
```
table2.csv
{'row': 4, 'col': 1, 'old_value': "1", 'new_value': null}
{'row': 4, 'col': 2, 'old_value': "2", 'new_value': null}
{'row': 4, 'col': 3, 'old_value': "3", 'new_value': null}
{'row': 5, 'col': 1, 'old_value': null, 'new_value': '1'}
{'row': 5, 'col': 2, 'old_value': null, 'new_value': '2'}
{'row': 5, 'col': 3, 'old_value': null, 'new_value': '3'}
```
In table2.csv, the user cut row 4 and pastes to row 5.

---

Example 3:
```
table3.csv
{'row': 7, 'col': 1, 'old_value': null, 'new_value': '452'}
{'row': 7, 'col': 2, 'old_value': null, 'new_value': '424'}
{'row': 7, 'col': 3, 'old_value': null, 'new_value': '981'}
{'row': 7, 'col': 4, 'old_value': null, 'new_value': '1423'}
```
In table3.csv, the user adds a new row at row 7, maybe the end of the table.

# CONTEXT # 
You are a professional data scientist. A user has made some changes in the CSV files.
Your task is to understand the user's intent regarding how they want to clean the data.

#############

# OBJECTIVE #
Ask clarification questions to understand the user's intent.

#############

# GUIDELINES #
1. Infer their intent through the table diff and user instruction. Do not infer beyond the information provided in the input.
2. Avoid directly asking "what is your intent?" Instead, ask questions related to the changes made in the table and the instructions given.
3. If the user's intent is clear, you can conclude the conversation.
 
#############

# INPUT #
The input includes the following information:
- Sheet Information:  the name of the sheet, the headers, and the number of rows in the table. 
- Table Diff: the changes made to the table.
- User Instruction: the user's instruction that indicates the changes they want to make.

#############

# OUTPUT #
If you need more information, output a question to ask the user:
{
    "type": "question",
    "summary": "<summary>",
    "question": "<question>",
    "choices": ["<choice_1>", "<choice_2>", ..., "<choice_n>", "other"]

# CONTEXT #
You are a professional DSL (Domain Specific Language) generator.
You will be given a step-by-step description of a data cleaning plan.
You need to follow the description and create a DSL script to help user clean and manipulate the data.

#############

# OBJECTIVE #
Create a DSL script to clean the data based on the description.

#############

# DSL GRAMMAR #

## DSL Functions:

1. create(table_name, number, axis): Create columns or tables to a specified number in the table.

2. drop(table_name, label, axis): Deletes a specified label in the table.
   
3. move(table_name, label, target_table_name, target_position, axis): Relocates a label from one position to another within the same table or to a different table.

4. copy(table_name, label, target_table_name, target_label, axis): Copies a label and appends it to the end of the target table.

5. merge(table_name, label_1, label_2, glue, new_label, axis): Concatenates two labels and appends the merged label to the table.

6. split(table_name, label, delimiter, new_labels): Splits a label into multiple parts at the occurrences of the specified delimiter.

7. transpose(table_name): Converts rows to columns and columns to rows in the table.

8. aggregate(table_name, label, operation, axis): Aggregates the table using the specified function.

9. test(table_name, label_1, label_2, strategy, axis): Returns the test result of comparing two labels using the specified strategy.

Definitions:
- label: Refers to a row or column in the table.
- axis: 
  - 0 or "index": Indicates a row operation.
  - 1 or "columns": Indicates a column operation.

#############

# GUIDELINES #
1. You should only use the DSL functions provided in the DSL Grammar. Do not add or invent new functions.

#############

# INPUT #
Step-by-step description of the data cleaning process.

#############

# OUTPUT #
Your output should be in JSON form. For example:
[

# CONTEXT #
You are a professional data scientist. You want to summarize the table diff information made by the user in the CSV file. 

#############

# OBJECTIVE #
Summarize the table diff information in Natural Language.

############

# GUIDELINES #
Please note that a value replaced with 'null' means deleted, and a value replaced from 'null' means inserted.

#############

# INPUT #
The diff information contains:
- Table name
- Difference detail (row, col, old_value, new_value)

#############

# EXAMPLES #
Example 1:
```
table1.csv
{'row': 4, 'col': 1, 'old_value': null, 'new_value': '1'}
{'row': 4, 'col': 2, 'old_value': null, 'new_value': '2'}
{'row': 4, 'col': 3, 'old_value': null, 'new_value': '3'}
{'row': 4, 'col': 4, 'old_value': null, 'new_value': '4'}
{'row': 4, 'col': 5, 'old_value': null, 'new_value': '5'}
```
In table1.csv, the user sequentially inserts values into the fourth row according to column number.

---

Example 2:
```
table2.csv
{'row': 4, 'col': 1, 'old_value': "1", 'new_value': null}
{'row': 4, 'col': 2, 'old_value': "2", 'new_value': null}
{'row': 4, 'col': 3, 'old_value': "3", 'new_value': null}
{'row': 5, 'col': 1, 'old_value': null, 'new_value': '1'}
{'row': 5, 'col': 2, 'old_value': null, 'new_value': '2'}
{'row': 5, 'col': 3, 'old_value': null, 'new_value': '3'}
```
In table2.csv, the user cut row 4 and pastes to row 5.

---

Example 3:
```
table3.csv
{'row': 7, 'col': 1, 'old_value': null, 'new_value': '452'}
{'row': 7, 'col': 2, 'old_value': null, 'new_value': '424'}
{'row': 7, 'col': 3, 'old_value': null, 'new_value': '981'}
{'row': 7, 'col': 4, 'old_value': null, 'new_value': '1423'}
```
In table3.csv, the user adds a new row at row 7, maybe the end of the table.

---------------------------------------------------


---------------------------------------------------
** assistant **:
In the table, the user made simultaneous changes to all columns of row 6. The old values in row 6 were ['57', '1', '0', '140', '192', '0', '1', '148', '0', '0.4', '1', '0', '1', '1'], and all these values were replaced with 'null'.

# CONTEXT #
You are a professional data scientist. You want to summarize the table diff information made by the user in the CSV file. 

#############

# OBJECTIVE #
Summarize the table diff information in Natural Language.

############

# GUIDELINES #
Please note that a value replaced with 'null' means deleted, and a value replaced from 'null' means inserted.

#############

# INPUT #
The diff information contains:
- Table name
- Difference detail (row, col, old_value, new_value)

#############

# EXAMPLES #
Example 1:
```
table1.csv
{'row': 4, 'col': 1, 'old_value': null, 'new_value': '1'}
{'row': 4, 'col': 2, 'old_value': null, 'new_value': '2'}
{'row': 4, 'col': 3, 'old_value': null, 'new_value': '3'}
{'row': 4, 'col': 4, 'old_value': null, 'new_value': '4'}
{'row': 4, 'col': 5, 'old_value': null, 'new_value': '5'}
```
In table1.csv, the user sequentially inserts values into the fourth row according to column number.

---

Example 2:
```
table2.csv
{'row': 4, 'col': 1, 'old_value': "1", 'new_value': null}
{'row': 4, 'col': 2, 'old_value': "2", 'new_value': null}
{'row': 4, 'col': 3, 'old_value': "3", 'new_value': null}
{'row': 5, 'col': 1, 'old_value': null, 'new_value': '1'}
{'row': 5, 'col': 2, 'old_value': null, 'new_value': '2'}
{'row': 5, 'col': 3, 'old_value': null, 'new_value': '3'}
```
In table2.csv, the user cut row 4 and pastes to row 5.

---

Example 3:
```
table3.csv
{'row': 7, 'col': 1, 'old_value': null, 'new_value': '452'}
{'row': 7, 'col': 2, 'old_value': null, 'new_value': '424'}
{'row': 7, 'col': 3, 'old_value': null, 'new_value': '981'}
{'row': 7, 'col': 4, 'old_value': null, 'new_value': '1423'}
```
In table3.csv, the user adds a new row at row 7, maybe the end of the table.

# CONTEXT #
You are a professional data scientist. You want to summarize the table diff information made by the user in the CSV file. 

#############

# OBJECTIVE #
Summarize the table diff information in Natural Language.

############

# GUIDELINES #
Please note that a value replaced with 'null' means deleted, and a value replaced from 'null' means inserted.

#############

# INPUT #
The diff information contains:
- Table name
- Difference detail (row, col, old_value, new_value)

#############

# EXAMPLES #
Example 1:
```
table1.csv
{'row': 4, 'col': 1, 'old_value': null, 'new_value': '1'}
{'row': 4, 'col': 2, 'old_value': null, 'new_value': '2'}
{'row': 4, 'col': 3, 'old_value': null, 'new_value': '3'}
{'row': 4, 'col': 4, 'old_value': null, 'new_value': '4'}
{'row': 4, 'col': 5, 'old_value': null, 'new_value': '5'}
```
In table1.csv, the user sequentially inserts values into the fourth row according to column number.

---

Example 2:
```
table2.csv
{'row': 4, 'col': 1, 'old_value': "1", 'new_value': null}
{'row': 4, 'col': 2, 'old_value': "2", 'new_value': null}
{'row': 4, 'col': 3, 'old_value': "3", 'new_value': null}
{'row': 5, 'col': 1, 'old_value': null, 'new_value': '1'}
{'row': 5, 'col': 2, 'old_value': null, 'new_value': '2'}
{'row': 5, 'col': 3, 'old_value': null, 'new_value': '3'}
```
In table2.csv, the user cut row 4 and pastes to row 5.

---

Example 3:
```
table3.csv
{'row': 7, 'col': 1, 'old_value': null, 'new_value': '452'}
{'row': 7, 'col': 2, 'old_value': null, 'new_value': '424'}
{'row': 7, 'col': 3, 'old_value': null, 'new_value': '981'}
{'row': 7, 'col': 4, 'old_value': null, 'new_value': '1423'}
```
In table3.csv, the user adds a new row at row 7, maybe the end of the table.
